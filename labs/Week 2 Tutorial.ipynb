    "Welcome to your first tutorial for DATA2x01! We are excited to guide you through a course that should prove both challenging and relevant in a world dominated by DATA. Each week will feature a set of coding exercises, of which your tutor will demonstrate some, while others will be left as an exercise for you to complete.\n",

    "The topic for this week is exploratory data analysis with Python, namely using `pandas` and `matplotlib` to perform initial data wrangling and visualisation on **Apple Music** Data from one of our 2022 tutors. Both offer detailed streaming history, but for simplicity, this tutorial focuses on the **music library** of songs itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you happen to be an Apple Music customer yourself, feel free to download a [copy of your own data](https://privacy.apple.com), and use this instead of the dataset we provide. Alternatively, Spotify users may still be interested in their information, and this can be downloaded [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy), though this wonâ€™t be as useful for this tutorial (less in-depth, in JSON not CSV form, and contains other fascinating/frightening details, such as defining users based on their listening preferences e.g. \"in-car listening\", \"fitness\" or \"studying or focussing\"). Both also take a couple days to prepare, so you may have to return at a later date to re-crunch the numbers on your own data."
